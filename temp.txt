> Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
- "agent is incentivized to succeed at the task while also acting as randomly as possible"
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05905

> (Asynchronous) Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C/A3C, same thing just diff implementation)
- multiple agents train in parallel to update global model
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783

> Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- clipping rule to limit how large policy changes can be
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347

> Phasic Policy Gradient (PPG)
- extension of PPO, seperately optimizes policy and value function
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04416

> Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- uses a deep neural network to approximate Q function
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602

> Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER)
- uses a deep neural net to estimate policy and value functions
- reuses past experiences
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01224
